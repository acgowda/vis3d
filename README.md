# vis3d
This program was created to visualize multivariable surfaces. 
The fourth variable (w) is represented by time. The program will animate the function within the given bounds.

## Usage:
Enter implicit functions with Python syntax. Numpy functions are allowed.

### Ex.
`x**2 + y**2 + z**2`
`(x**2)/4 - (y**2)/4 - z/4`
`x**2 + y**2 + z**2 + np.sin(x*y)`
