# vis3d

This program was created to visualize multivariable surfaces.
The program will animate the given function within the provided bounds.
This allows for visualization of the function at different values of w.

## Usage:

Run the program with the following command:

`python Window.py`

Enter implicit functions with Python syntax. Numpy functions are allowed.

### Ex.

`x**2 + y**2 + z**2`

`(x**2)/4 - (y**2)/4 - z/4`

`x**2 + y**2 + z**2 + np.sin(x*y)`
